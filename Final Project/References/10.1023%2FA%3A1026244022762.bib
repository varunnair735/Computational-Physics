abstract="A mathematical model of a steady viscous incompressible fluid flow in a channel with exit conditions different from the Dirichlet conditions is considered. A variational inequality is derived for the formulated subdifferential boundary-value problem, and the structure of the set of its solutions is studied. For two-ption on the low Reynolds number is proved. In the three-dimensional case, a class of constraints on the tangential component of velocity at the exit, which guarantees solvability of the variational inequality, is found.",
